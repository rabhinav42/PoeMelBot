Tolls in fog the warning bell ..
Which mocked at the coal - black Angel ?.
' Neath the willows by the stream ;.
He'd ascend in love - ditty , kissing fingers to.
Methought , my sweet one , then ceased to soar ,.
Bunting hoisted to flutter at the gaff - -.
Lying , it fancies.

Of the prodigy and crime ,.
And the fever called " Living ".

The stripling soldiers passed her door ,.
In bullioned standards rustling low ,.
With a despotic sway all giant minds ..

" You bravely fight " each to the other said - -.
Raising his heavy eyelid , starts and sees.
Along the spurs of ridges pale ,.
( Dim gulf ! ) my spirit hovering lies.
Then stirred the god within the breast - -.
Inscribes even on her shards of broken urns.
For have revelled when the sun was bright.
Nay , pardon , old aunty ! Wife , never let it fall ,.
You'll say ' m doting ; do you think.
So mournfully - - so mournfully ,.
For the spirit that walks in shadow.
In bed muse on Tenier's boors ,.
And follow , follow fast in wake ,.
Quaff there , at high tide , to the uttermost.
Tread ashes - - but let mosses sweet.
About a carved memorial stone.
And thus thy memory is to me.
" Doubtless , " said , " what it utters is its only stock and store ,.
No blabber , no , not even with the can - -.
Over the bowling billows are gliding :.
( From man's changeless heart their way they.
As before Vera - Cruz , when he dashed splashing.
Draw trigger on them if you can ..
With screams their wheeling rites - - then sped.
Pretty stem for the port , trow !.
From my books surcease of sorrow - - sorrow for the lost Lenore - -.
Slow - swaying palms salute love's cypress tree.
Was it not Fate , that , on this July midnight - -.
Away away - - ' mid seas of rays that roll.
_Flying Dutchman_ - - odds bobbs - - off the.
By chapel bare , with walls sea - beat.
And , quaffing , dip in wine their beards of.
And ye may mourn ,.
Shall Time with creeping influence cold.

Aflame from climes of sacrifice.
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses ,.
And how a lieutenant may genially haze ;.
And late to ours , the favour'd one of God - -.
Whether Tempter sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore ,.
Then old upbraiding best forbear :.
Sure thou art come o'er far - off seas ,.
In lane that endless rules the war - ship's flight ..
The gold - fish fly in golden flashes !.
Were in their strength subdued ,.
It shall not be forgot !.
Not the gaily - jewelled dead.
And so he lingers - - lingers on.
Beneath the moon - ray - -.
From collision never shrinking ,.
Invisible Wo !.
But he grew old - -.
Beholds it but through darkened glasses ..
When homeward footing it in the sun.
Yet the ear distinctly tells ,.
And as it fluttered - - fell.
That blushed and bloomed ,.
Peeled to the waistband , the marble flesh.
The word to uplift ..
Thou who beholdest , if thy thought ,.
suddenly in the heavens - - attained , in a few days , a brilliancy.
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain.
The clangor of that blacksmiths ' fray ..
Taught me my alphabet to say - -.
It musks the amber wine ;.
Silence ! and Desolation ! and dim Night !.
Of mine own thought - - what more could have seen ?.
With all thy train , athwart the moony sky - -.
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells !.
Walked in beauty at my side ..
Were seen no more : the very roses ' odors.
Rivetting the bolts in the iron - clad's shell ,.
Beneath one roof they laid them down ;.

How it hangs upon the trees ,.
Preparatives of fate ..
The wave - - there is a movement there !.
Brigs that figs for market gather ,.
And downward the coming is seen ;.
But up and up each linking troop.
And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye.
The sea - fowl here , whose hearts none know ,.
And the wrangling ,.
With speed that may not tire.
And sweeping wings of war ..
After long wars when comes release.
Or spell had bound me - - ' twas the chilly wind.

Towering afar in parting light ,.
Of the tresses of Annie ..
Bulwarks gone - - a shaven wreck ,.
He tries to think - - to recollect ,.
Oh , the waters that flow through Onimoo ;.
But fronting shot and flanking shell.
ripple laps the coppered side ,.
But who a flattering tide may trust ,.
Like the light of stars serene ;.
